## Problem Statement
Given a binary tree as a sequence of (parent, child) tuples: (A B)(A C)(B G)(C H)(E F)(B D)(C E) Write a program to find following errors in the tree:
  E1: More than 2 children

  E2: Duplicate Tuples

  E3: Cycle present

  E4: Multiple roots

  E5: Multiple parents

Input is a expression containing parent child relations. output is Error codes or success.



## Sample test cases
    Input: (A B)(A C)(B G)(C H)(E F)(B D)(C E) Output: Success
    Input: (A B)(A C)(A D) Output: E1
    Input: (A B)(A B) Output: E2
    Input: (A B)(B C)(C A) Output: E3
    Input: (A B)(C D) Output: E4
    Input: (A B)(B C)(A C) Output: E5
